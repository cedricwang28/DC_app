                    <li>UNIQUE ARCHITECTURE</li>
                    <p>The historical significance of the house results not only from its link with the Robinson Family but also because of its unique architecture. </p>
                    <p>The house has a gambrel roof constituting an essential part of the upper gallery, not often found in Canada. The Historical Society launched a campaign to restore the house as a centennial project. </p>

                    <p>After restored, the house was opened as a museum.</p>
                    <p>The house now stands as a lasting testament to one of Oshawa’s early families, the Robinsons.</p>
